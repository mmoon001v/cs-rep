  <h4 style= "text-align:center"> ABSTRACT </h4>

  <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The burn site in Mesa Verde, Colorado from over 20 years ago has yet to regrow its pinyon–juniper (<i>Pinus edulis</i> and <i>Juniperus osteosperma</i>) forest. Instead, native and invasive grasses dominate the site which raises the question if these grasses are affecting the beneficial fungi that associate with pinyon pine and improve its growth and survival. In this study, we focused on a pinyon root endophyte and how it was affected by the native grass, <i>Poa fendleriana</i> (muttongrass), and the invasive grass, <i>Bromus tectorum</i> (cheatgrass). Cheatgrass and muttongrass seeds were sterilized, germinated and placed into a PDA dish with a subculture of pinyon root endophytes to observe how these grasses affect the growth of the fungi, when alive or dead. Both grass species negatively affected the growth of the fungal endophyte, but only when they were alive and in close proximity to it. The grasses may have released a chemical that inhibited fungal endophyte growth, which could help explain why pinyons have failed to establish after fire.

  <h4> INTRODUCTION </h4>
  
  <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There has been an increase in frequent and severe fires across the US including at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado. These full-grown forests of pinyon pines and junipers  (<i>Pinus edulis</i> and <i>Juniperus osteosperma</i>) are completely lost to these recurring fires where the area’s history is unfamiliar and unadaptable to these natural disasters  (Floyd et al 2004).
In 2002, there was a wildfire in the Mesa Verde pinyon-juniper forest (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) where this burn site has yet to regrow its trees. Instead, it is overcome with grasses like the native species muttongrass (<i>Poa fendleriana, PF</i>) and the invasive species cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum, BT</i>).

Mycorrhizal fungi can be found underground and in vast connection systems attached to plant roots where they aid plants in their development by collecting water and nutrients. Some  types of mycorrhizal fungi have evolved with plants to help benefit them in extreme conditions like with drought tolerance (Gehring et al., 2017). Other fungi, called endophytes, are also found inside the plant’s roots and can be beneficial symbionts (Rodriguez et al., 2009). The particular endophyte that is studied in this experiment is a  pinyon root endophyte (PRE) (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>) which are found within the root cells of the pinyon pine trees. Plants can also produce root exudates, chemicals from their roots, to deter or encourage interactions with other organisms (Malinowski & Belesky, 2000). If grasses produce chemicals that <strong>negatively</strong> affect the fungal symbionts of pinyon pine, they may contribute to the lack of regeneration following fire.

Observing pinyon root endophytes (PRE) in culture (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>) with native and invasive grasses can display how they have been interacting with fungi that are helpful to pinyon pines. This will help answer the question: <strong>How will these grasses affect the growth of a pinyon root endophytic fungus?</strong>

<h4> METHODS </h4>
	<p><i> Prepping the Experiment</i>
	</p>

<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	To prepare for this experiment, BT and PF seeds were collected to sterilize before placing them in agar to start germination. All grass seeds were sourced locally on the Colorado Plateau. Pinyon root endophytes were also reawakened from archived perlite samples, to start growing and eventually be used in subcultures for the experiment.
<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	The seed sterilization procedure took place within a sterile laminar flow hood. Seeds were entered into the flow hood on a plate separated by their species. One plate was picked up and sprayed with 70% ethanol until their surface was completely covered. The sprayed seeds were left to sit for 30 seconds. Then the seeds were collected inside of a falcon tube. Using a solution of 10% bleach (0.5% NaOCl) and tap water, it was poured inside of the tube with the seeds and was covered with a lid. The tube is then shaken for one minute and let to set for another minute. After the 2 minutes of bleach washing is over, the lid is removed from the tube and a small sterile screen is put over the mouth of the tube. The tube is turned to the side to pour out the bleach into a waste beaker while holding the screen tightly, so the seeds do not fall out. Then autoclaved water is poured into the beaker with the seeds to rinse them for another 30 seconds. The water is then poured out into a waste beaker and the seeds have become sterile. This entire sterilization process is repeated for the other tray holding the other seed species.
<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	After all of the seeds are sterilized, 10 seeds of a species are placed inside a plate of water agar. This process was repeated with many plates to optimize the amount of germinated seedlings for the experiment. The water agar plates with the seeds are then labeled with their seed species type and plate replication, and put inside a grow tent.

<p><i> 
Plating and Start of Experiment
</i></p>
	<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Once the seedlings had germinated, 10 cheatgrass and 10 muttongrass germinated seedlings were collected from the water agar. All the seedlings in the treatment group were paired to seedlings with similar physical characteristics in the control group. This was included to make sure there was less variance across each treatment. Five seedlings of each species were put aside for the live treatment of each species. While the other 10 seedlings were put in a weight boat in an oven for 2 hours at 50℃, and were to be used as the dead treatments. The dead treatment was to create a dead plant control, it was hypothesized that the living plants could potentially interact with the fungi more with potential exudates while the dead plants would not produce these chemicals.
<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	From the reawakened PRE subcultured dishes, using a cork borer, 25 subcultures of the PRE were taken and one was placed in the center of each of the 20 ml PDA plates.
	Following the treatment placement design for the experiment in <strong>Fig. 5</strong> below, each treatment of seed was placed 1 cm away from the edge of the plate.

<div class="center">
<br><strong> Figure 5. Measuring Placement Design for the experiment.
</strong>

	<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Each treatment had 5 replications, where a PRE subculture was in the center with either of the following treatments:
<ul>
<li>Live cheatgrass seedling (BT Alive) </li>
<li>Live muttongrass seedling (POA Alive)</li>
<li>Dead BT seedling (BT Dead)</li>
<li>Dead POA seedling (POA Dead)</li>
<li>Control (PRE only)</li>
</ul>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	In total, there were 25 plates of 20 ml of PDA. The entire plating process took place within a laminar flow hood, with all the tools and materials sanitized inside before the procedure started. During the plating process, a small beaker with 95% ethanol and a small ethanol flame was used to sanitize the utensils used throughout the procedure. Each utensil before each use, was dipped and swirled inside the ethanol beaker and hovered over the ethanol flame for 10 seconds to sterilize. A 0.9 cm diameter cork borer was used to collect the PRE subculture, followed by a flat rounded scalpel to pick up the subculture and place the fungi side down onto the treatment plates. Then a scalpel was used to slice inside the PDA so that the plant treatments could fit within the pocket. After each plate’s treatments were aligned correctly, each plate was parafilmed shut, labeled with an ID code, and put into a grow tent to germinate.

<p><i> 
Method of Data Collection
</i></p>
	<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Once the plates were set in the grow tent, every day that followed each plate was checked for potential contamination or observed of any changes from the day before. The data was put into a spreadsheet according to the code of the plate. Each treatment was checked to make sure the treatment was not changed, for example making sure all alive treatments were alive and all dead treatments were dead. Any and all observed changes were recorded within the spreadsheet.
	<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	On day 16 of the experiment, the radial measurements of fungal growth were taken from each of the plates (Fig. 7). The edges of the fungal growth and the shape of the PRE plug were both outlined at the bottom of the plate with a permanent marker. Two drawn axes were made perpendicular to each other, with their intersection at the center of the plug of the PRE subculture. At the edge of the plug outline, a ruler measured the length of each axis until the outlined edge of the fungal growth. These 4 points of measurements on these axes were labeled either Near Grass (NG) or Away Grass (AG). The axis’ label was determined by its position to the grass (Fig. 7).

<strong>RESULTS</strong>
	</p>
	<p>

An analysis of variance was used to test if fungal growth differed among treatments. The averages and standard of errors of each measurement of the plates’ fungal radial growth were taken and applied to the variance analysis (<strong>Table 1</strong>).

<strong>Figure 9. Comparison of the average radial growth of the PRE fungus Away from the plant measured on Day 16. There was no significant difference between any of the 5 treatments.</strong>
<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Through a one-way variance analysis (<strong>Fig. 9</strong>), there showed to not be a significant difference between the averages of the radial measurements Away from the plant treatment across the treatment types. Even with the control having no plant involved, the fungal growth for the rest of the treatments away from the plant appeared to show around the same radial average.

</strong>
<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Although a statistical analysis of the variance between the pinyon endophyte treatments showed that grasses promoted growth a small amount (<strong>Fig. 10</strong>), the difference among treatments was not statistically significant (<strong>Table 2</strong>).

<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The 3 way analysis of variance (Table 3) showed that plant species did not significantly affect PRE growth (F<sub>1,30</sub> = 1.005, p = 0.324) but fungal growth was negatively affected by a living grass of either species
(nearoraway F<sub>1,30</sub> = 11.411, p = 0.002 ;  deadalive F<sub>1,30</sub> = 5.822, p = 0.022 + nearoraway*deadalive F<sub>1,30</sub> = 4.961, p = 0.034)

	<p>
<strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
	<p>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	Through interpreting the p-values of the data analysis (<strong>Table 3</strong>), it can be concluded that plant species did not significantly affect PRE growth, but instead fungal growth was <strong>negatively</strong> affected by a <strong>living</strong> grass of either <strong>species</strong>.
	<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	When conducting the one-way analysis of variance the results were not statistically significant to conclude that the plant within the treatment alone would have inhibited the growth of the fungus. However, when conducting a 3 way variance analysis, with the interactions being “<i>Plant species x near/away x dead/alive</i>”,  the fungal growth showed a significant difference in its growth by a living grass of either species. The fungal growth displayed negative growth if being <i>Near</i> the plant and having a <i>Live</i> plant.
	<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	A potential reason for the results was possible exudates that were released from the live plants which inhibited the growth of the fungi. Root exudates are known to be released into the rhizosphere for many reasons, one reason being as a result of a stressful environment. For example, in stressful environments, endophytes can encourage their hosts to grow longer root hairs to and to change the chemical composition of exudate to allow for more efficient nutrient absorption and toxic metals tolerance (Malinowski & Belesky, 2000). However the grasses in this study could be expelling an exudate that <strong>negatively</strong> affects the growth of PRE which are found in pinyon pines.
	<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	When repeating this experiment, measurements of root and leaf lengths and the number of fungal spores and rings should be taken as the experiment progresses. The direction that the roots grow, whether toward or away the fungi, should be recorded as well. 
	<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	The protocol can be adjusted by removing the making of slits within the PDA, removing possible stress to the live seedling’s roots, and by preparing the dead seedling treatment within a covered dish. The protocol could also include testing for potential exudates from the live plants and using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry or other methods to identify them. This can potentially explain the reason as to why the fungi’s growth is being negatively affected. 
	<br>	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	This experiment can be adjusted to measure a number of many different variables. This experiment can be replicated again but with different fungal types such as <i>Suillus</i> or <i>Hebeloma</i>, both of which are mycorrhizal fungi. Altering the treatments can help identify which fungi are more affected by these grasses and potentially identify which fungi can be most helpful to the regrowth of these pinyon pines. These results may be important when planning restoration projects where grass removal or planting tree seedlings might be involved.
